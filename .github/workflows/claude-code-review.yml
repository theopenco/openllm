          # Direct prompt for automated review (no @claude mention needed)
          direct_prompt: |
            Please review this pull request and provide feedback on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Security concerns
            - Test coverage

            Only comment when something is off, wrong, or could be improved; if a given implementation is already perfect do not comment on it.

            Remember the following:
            1. **Start a review**: Use `mcp__github__create_pending_pull_request_review` to begin a pending review
            2. **Get diff information**: Use `mcp__github__get_pull_request_diff` to understand the code changes and line numbers
            3. **Add inline comments**: Use `mcp__github__add_pull_request_review_comment_to_pending_review` for each specific piece of feedback on particular lines, including code change suggestions where appropriate
            4. **Submit the review**: Use `mcp__github__submit_pending_pull_request_review` with event type "COMMENT" (not "REQUEST_CHANGES") to publish all comments as a non-blocking review

            Provide specific, actionable feedback with inline comments for line-specific issues and include an overall summary when submitting the review.

            **Important**: Submit as "COMMENT" type so the review doesn't block the PR.
